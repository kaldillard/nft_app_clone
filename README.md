# nft_app_clone

A new Flutter project.

NFT Marketplace App UI Summary
This is a UI-only implementation of an NFT marketplace application built with Flutter. The app focuses on providing users with a modern, glass-morphism design for exploring and discovering NFT collections.
Key Features:
Main Dashboard:

Collection Explorer: Primary "Explore Collections" section for NFT discovery
Search Functionality: Integrated search button for finding specific NFTs or collections
Responsive Design: Uses flutter_screenutil for consistent sizing across devices

Navigation & Browsing:

Tab-Based Browsing: Three main discovery categories:

Recent: Latest NFT drops and newly listed items
Trending: Popular and hot NFTs currently gaining traction
Top: Highest-rated or most valuable NFT collections


Bottom Navigation: Custom glass-effect navigation bar for seamless app navigation
Extended Body Layout: Modern full-screen design with floating navigation

Design Highlights:

Glass Morphism Effect: Sophisticated frosted glass UI elements using custom GlassBox component
Modern Aesthetic: Clean, contemporary design with subtle backgrounds
Custom Components:

Reusable MyAppBar with integrated search
Custom MyTabBar for category switching
Stylized MyBottomBar with glass effects


Smooth Transitions: Tab switching and navigation state management

Technical Architecture:

Modular Structure: Well-organized with separate model classes for UI components
State Management: Proper StatefulWidget implementation for navigation and tab states
Custom Theming: Integrated theme system with glass box styling

Note: This is currently a UI prototype only - the search functionality, NFT data, and marketplace interactions are visual mockups without actual blockchain integration or real NFT data. The app demonstrates the user interface design and user experience flow for a fully-featured NFT marketplace application.
The app provides a solid foundation for implementing real NFT marketplace features like wallet connection, bidding, purchasing, and collection management.
